h2Getting Tickets & Picking the Showsh2
p
If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help
you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a
schedule and this is a biggie SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying about
blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out
prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.
Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

h2Dressing for the Showsh2
p
Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be
uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll
be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be
on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
